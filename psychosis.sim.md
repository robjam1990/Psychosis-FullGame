# Welcome to Psychosis, a text-based game set in the vast expanses of Thear

## You are about to embark on an odyssey that will take you to unimaginable heights, where the boundaries of reality blur, and the possibilities are as infinite as the cosmos itself

Before we begin, let's start with the main menu. You have the following options:

- 1. New Game - Start a new adventure in Thear.
- 2. Save Game - Save your current game state.
- 3. Load Game - Load a saved game.
- 4. Delete Game - Delete a saved game.
- 0. Quit - Exit the game.

Please enter your choice by typing the corresponding number.

(Note: The main menu is displayed using the ShowMenu method, which is defined in the GameState class. The method uses a switch statement to handle user input and direct the program flow accordingly. The main menu options are displayed using Console.WriteLine statements, and the user's input is read using Console.ReadLine.)

Now, let's assume you choose option 1, New Game. The method CreateNewCharacter is called, which prompts you to enter your name, Traveller.

(Note: The CreateNewCharacter method is defined in the GameState class. It uses a Console.WriteLine statement to prompt the user for their name, and then creates a new Player instance with the entered name. The currentPlayer variable is assigned the new Player instance, and the method calls SaveGame to save the new game state. The SaveGame method is defined in the GameState class, and it uses the JsonSerializer class to serialize the currentPlayer instance into a JSON string, which is then written to a file in the "saves" directory.)

After creating your character, you find yourself in the bustling town of Nexus, nestled within the intricate tapestry of the Main Hall of Nexus Tavern. The town is filled with patrons, and you can hear the clinking of tankards and murmurs of conversation all around you.

As you explore the town, you notice a group of guards standing near the entrance of the tavern. They seem to be eyeing you suspiciously. One of them steps forward and blocks your path.

"Halt, traveler," he says. "What brings you to Nexus? State your business, and be quick about it."

You have the following options:

1. "I'm just looking for a place to rest my weary head. Do you know of any available rooms?"
2. "I'm on a quest to retrieve a rare artifact. Have you seen anything suspicious around here?"
3. "I'm just here to enjoy a drink and some company. Can I please pass?"

Please enter your choice by typing the corresponding number.

(Note: The dialogue with the guard is displayed using a Console.WriteLine statement, and the user's input is read using Console.ReadLine. The switch statement is used to handle user input and direct the program flow accordingly. The guard's response is displayed using another Console.WriteLine statement.)

Now, let's assume you choose option 1, "I'm just looking for a place to rest my weary head. Do you know of any available rooms?" The guard nods and says, "There's a room available at the local inn, but it's not exactly the most luxurious place. Still, it's better than sleeping on the streets. Follow me."

He leads you to the inn, and you thank him for his help. As you enter the inn, you notice a group of shady-looking characters huddled in the corner, whispering among themselves. One of them catches your eye and nods subtly.

You have the following options:

1. Ignore them and proceed to the bar to order a drink.
2. Approach them and try to strike up a conversation.
3. Keep a safe distance and observe them from afar.

Please enter your choice by typing the corresponding number.

(Note: The scene with the shady-looking characters is displayed using a Console.WriteLine statement, and the user's input is read using Console.ReadLine. The switch statement is used to handle user input and direct the program flow accordingly.)

Now, let's assume you choose option 2, "Approach them and try to strike up a conversation." As you approach the group, they fall silent, eyeing you warily. One of them steps forward and asks, "What do you want?"

You explain that you're a traveler looking for information on the local area. The group's leader.

Now, let's assume you choose option 2, "Beer." The bartender hands you a mug of frothy ale, and you take a refreshing sip.

As you drink, you notice a group of adventurers gathered in the corner, discussing their recent quests. One of them catches your eye and nods subtly.

Now, let's assume you choose option 1, "Ask for more information about the artifact and the dungeon." The adventurers explain that the artifact is a powerful magical sword that can only be wielded by a chosen few. The dungeon is said to be filled with dangerous creatures and deadly traps, and the sword is guarded by a powerful dragon.

You thank the adventurers for the information and decide to join them on their quest. You spend the rest of the evening preparing for the journey and getting to know your new allies.

At dawn, you meet the adventurers at the dungeon entrance and begin your journey into the depths of the dragon's lair.

As you explore the dungeon, you encounter various obstacles and challenges. You use your skills and abilities to overcome them and get closer to the dragon's lair.

Finally, you reach the dragon's chamber and engage in a fierce battle with the beast. After a long and grueling fight, you emerge victorious and claim the magical sword as your own.

Congratulations, you have completed the quest!
